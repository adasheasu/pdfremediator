## To Push to GitHub

You have two options to push these changes:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
cd /Users/alejandradashe/pdfremediator_github
gh auth login
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Using HTTPS with Personal Access Token

1. **Create a Personal Access Token** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Copy the token (you'll need it in step 3)

2. **Navigate to the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/alejandradashe/pdfremediator_github
   ```

3. **Push with authentication**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   When prompted for username and password:
   - Username: `adasheasu`
   - Password: [paste your Personal Access Token]

### Option 3: Configure Git Credentials Helper

To avoid entering credentials each time:

```bash
cd /Users/alejandradashe/pdfremediator_github

# Store credentials in macOS Keychain
git config credential.helper osxkeychain

# Then push
git push origin main
```

When prompted, enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token.

### Option 4: Switch to SSH (One-time setup)

If you prefer SSH authentication:

```bash
cd /Users/alejandradashe/pdfremediator_github

# Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:adasheasu/pdfremediator.git

# Push (requires SSH key setup)
git push origin main
```

Note: This requires SSH keys to be configured with your GitHub account.

## Verification After Push

After pushing, verify the changes at:
https://github.com/adasheasu/pdfremediator

You should see:
1. ✅ Updated README.md with artifact marking documentation
2. ✅ New CHANGELOG.md file in the repository
3. ✅ Updated pdf_remediator.py (81K size)
4. ✅ Latest commit message visible on main branch

## Troubleshooting

### "fatal: could not read Username"
- This means authentication is required
- Use one of the authentication options above

### "Authentication failed"
- Ensure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password
- Verify the token has `repo` scope permissions

### "Permission denied (publickey)"
- This occurs when using SSH without proper key setup
- Either set up SSH keys or use HTTPS authentication

### "Updates were rejected"
- Someone else may have pushed to the repository
- Run `git pull origin main` first, then push again
