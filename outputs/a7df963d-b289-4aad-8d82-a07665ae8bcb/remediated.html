<p>Sometimes you’ll be asked for a hypothesis, or to state what you’ve learned about a topic</p>
<p>before The Living World. These learning activities are called formative learning activities,</p>
<p>and they’re worth 1 point. Usually, there’s no right or wrong answer or maximum number</p>
<p>of tries, and you’ll get full credit upon inputting your hypothesis, opinion, or what you’ve</p>
<p>learned before. We often use these to compare how much you’ve learned and to show</p>
<p>you later, so be sure to be honest!</p>
<p>Review Screens (0 points each)</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll need to review material to make sure you’re ready for new adventures</p>
<p>ahead. For these learning activities, you’re reviewing material you’ve already been</p>
<p>scored on, so the second time around isn’t worth points, but it’s valuable practice that will</p>
<p>help you earn more points in your lesson.</p>
<p>Simulation Screens (10 points each)</p>
<p>These are learning activities where you’ll interact with a complex, custom simulation to</p>
<p>demonstrate what you’ve learned or to learn something new. You might build DNA,</p>
<p>explore the role of carbon in Earth’s ecosystems, or see what happens to a population of</p>
<p>finches during a drought. Each of these learning activities is worth 10 points, and you’ll</p>
<p>earn all 10 when you succeed, no matter how many tries it takes. Unlike instructional</p>
<p>learning activities, most simulation learning activities require you to succeed to proceed,</p>
<p>but there is no maximum number of tries.</p>
<p>Summative Screens (20 points each)</p>
<p>This is as close as The Living World gets to a traditional test. After you’ve been learning</p>
<p>about a concept for a while and performing various activities, or perhaps at the end of an</p>
<p>experiment, you’ll be asked to show just how much you’ve learned. These learning</p>
<p>activities offer less help and assistance because you’ve had a lot of practice, and are</p>
<p>worth 20 points. Like instructional learning activities, you’ll have a limited number of tries</p>
<p>and your score will decrease each time.</p>

<p>Learner Behavior</p>
<p>Learners are expected to help create and curate an environment conducive to effective</p>
<p>learning and engagement for all participants. Behavior that disrupts teaching and</p>
<p>learning is unacceptable, even in an online or asynchronous environment such as</p>
<p>discussion boards. Diverse opinions and engaging discussions are critical to learning, but</p>
<p>behaviors that inhibit others from participating or learning may result in disciplinary or</p>
<p>administrative actions.</p>
